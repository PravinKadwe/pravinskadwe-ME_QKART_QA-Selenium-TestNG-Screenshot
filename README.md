### During the course of this project,
	  1.Debugged failing test cases and issues with log statements
	  2.Automated testing with selenium
	  3.Utilised implicit and explicit waits correctly to avoid synchronisation issues
	  4.Improved the tests with XPath
	  5.Migrated tests to the TestNG test automation framework
	  6.Performed Data-driven test automation with Apache POI

## Enhance reliability of the automation code by using implicit and explicit waits correctly
### Scope of Work
	1.Placed appropriate wait statements in the code base to improve script synchronization
	2.Implemented feature request to take screenshots before and after the test case and also capture screenshots in case of error
	3.Performed automation tests/validations that span across different browser tabs and windows

### Skills used

## Making the automation code more resilient with XPath
### Scope of Work
	  1.Fixed a few bugs in the existing codebase as a result of incorrect locators by replacing them with XPath
	  2.Improved code by replacing existing locators with Dynamic XPath

### Skills used
Java, Selenium, Locators, HTML, Developer Tools, XPath

## Using TestNG to enable features like grouping, prioritising, and parameterising of tests
### Scope of Work
	1.Migrated existing Selenium test code to use the TestNG framework
	2.Parameterised the test cases and used XML configuration to send the parameters dynamically
	3.Created sanity and regression test groups
	4.Utilised Test Listeners to take screenshots on different events
